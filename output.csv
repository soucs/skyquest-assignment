The global cladding systems market has witnessed high growth primarily because of the increasing infrastructure and construction activities worldwide. Not only these systems protect the building structure, but they also enhance the appearance of a building. Rebound in commercial construction is expected to increase the demand for the external cladding system.
""In terms of both value, and volume, the ceramic cladding segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.""
Ceramic is mainly used for tile cladding, and hence plays an important role in the construction industry. The ceramic tiles enhance the overall atmosphere of a residential or commercial landscape. The selection of the type of these tiles is based on several factors such as ease of maintenance, durability, comfort, safety, style, and design templates. Foot traffic plays an important role in the selection of the type of ceramic tiles. For example, government offices would require solid, highly durable floors due to high foot traffic. The wall tiles are employed in the interior as well as the exterior of the building to meet the requirements of decoration or aesthetics. The usage of ceramic tiles ranges from bathrooms and kitchens in households to laboratories, restaurants, medical centers, shopping centers, schools, and government buildings.
""In terms of both, value and volume, the wall segment is projected to lead the cladding systems market from 2020 to 2026.""
Wall claddings are designed to protect exterior wall from effects of weathering and to enhance the appearance of the walls in a building. Wall cladding with the use of materials such as ceramic, brick & stone, stucco & EIFS are gaining significant momentum, especially in residential buildings. In commercial buildings such as warehouses and manufacturing plants, concrete and metal form the main wall cladding systems. Concrete cladding such as slabs and precast panels are widely used in industrial applications. Metal cladding, for example steel, are also used in other industrial buildings such cool stores and freezing units.
""The residential segment is estimated to grow at highest CAGR during the forecast period, in terms of both value and volume.""
Demand for cladding in the residential segment is primarily attributed to the aesthetic appeal, along with properties such as durability and protection from extreme weather. Other benefits such as fire protection and high thermal efficiency will further drive the demand for cladding systems. Most favorable materials for residential cladding systems include fiber cement, vinyl, bricks, and timber wood. The spending in residential construction is estimated to witness a surge, particularly in the emerging Asia Pacific and South American regions; there is a trend of urbanization observed in these regions, resulting in a higher growth rate for the residential construction market, as compared to developed markets.
""In terms of both value and volume, the Asia Pacific cladding systems market is projected to contribute the maximum market share during the forecast period.""
In terms of value and volume, the Asia Pacific region is projected to lead the cladding systems market from 2021 to 2026 due to the strong demand from countries such as the China and India. The demand is also driven by the increasing availability of raw materials and manpower, along with sophisticated technologies and innovations in this region. Major drivers of the cladding systems market in this region are the growing construction sector, particularly in rapidly growing countries such as China and India and huge foreign investments. However, consumers in this region are price-conscious and lay a lot of importance on this criterion in every aspect of their purchase.

Wires & cables are often considered a commodity products and form a crucial component in an aircraft. Wires form cables, cables form wire harnesses and harnesses assembled along with other components such as conduits and sleeves, backshells, connectors, etc. form the wiring system or electronic wiring interconnect system (EWIS). Being one of the building block elements in aircraft functioning, wires & cables have ceaselessly been in demand with a gradual increase of usage in modern aircraft. For instance, Boeing 737 has ~40 miles of wires & cables. The company almost doubled the wires & cables consumption to 100 miles in its B767 program and further tripled to 310 miles in its B787 program. A similar trajectory has been recorded for the Airbus programs. Aerospace wires & cables are required to conform to several predetermined standards, distinct to each region.

An increase in awareness regarding renewable and bio-based products has resulted in an upsurge in the demand for pine-derived chemicals over the past few years. Pine-derived chemicals is a major commercial product of pine trees and it is used in the manufacturing of paints & coatings, adhesives & sealants, surfactants, and printing inks. Major market players have been investing significantly in R&D to boost production to cater to changing consumer preferences.
""By type, the gum rosin segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR in the market during the forecast period.""
Based on type, the gum rosin segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR in the market during the forecast period. Gum rosin is the oleoresin that is harvested by the periodic wounding of the tree and collecting the sap into cups. During the production of synthetic rubber and printing inks, resin acids are modified for further industrial use. Apart from this, gum rosin is used in the paints & coating industries, owing to this the demand for gum rosin is increasing.
""By source, by-products of sulfate pulping  segment is estimated to grow at higher CAGR.""
Sulfate processing is used to produce pine wood pulp, which consists of almost pure cellulose fibers by using sulfurous acid to extract the lignin from wood chips in digesters. Two main by-products, CTO and CST, are obtained in the pinewood pulping procedure. Both CTO and CST are used as a primary raw material to obtain pine chemicals like resins, fatty acids, etc. These pine chemicals demand is increasing due to their application in textile, fuel additives, construction chemicals, paints & coating, rubber, soaps & detergents, etc.
""By application, the adhesives & sealants segment is forecasted to account for the second-largest market share.""
Adhesives & sealants are versatile products that are obtained from pine trees. The automotive and construction industries are the two key sectors that use adhesives and sealants extensively. The natural stickiness of rosin makes it an ideal adhesion enhancer when added to adhesives and sealants. The players in the adhesives and sealants industry are expanding their presence across the globe.
""By process, the tapping process segment is anticipated to grow at higher CAGR during the review period.""
Tapping is a repeated wounding process of the tree trunk, which removes the bark and tissues beneath. There is a chemical stimulant application after this process to obtain Crude oleoresin, which is evaporated with steam distillation to obtain turpentine, molten rosin remains at the bottom after turpentine has been evaporated and recovered from a condenser. This rosin has a huge demand in the manufacturing of adhesives & sealants and paints & coatings.
""The North America region is the largest market for pine-derived chemicals during the forecast period""
North America is one of the largest markets for pine-derived chemicals worldwide as it holds a considerable share in the tall oil fatty acid segment. There has been a significant usage of pine-derived chemicals to produce a wide range of consumer products. North America has a developed market for pine-derived chemicals and is projected to grow at a steady rate.
